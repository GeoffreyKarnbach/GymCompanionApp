# Gym Companion App

No more need to rely on pen and paper to track your progress at the Gym!

## Concept

As a regular Gym Goer myself, I used to rely on tracking my exercises in each gym session on a piece of paper, and later on my notes app on my phone. I always missed one aspect when tracking my progress: I could only see my current weight for each exercise, but no progression over time.

The Gym Companion App has as main goal to create gym sessions with a list of exercises, and for each exercise to be able to track one's own progress.

The Mobile App has been coded with Swift, SwiftUI as framework, and SwiftData for persisting data locally on the device, and the entire User Interface is in German.

## Features of the App

When using the App, the user can:
- Create a new gym session ("Trainingsplan")
- Add exercises to a gym session, either pre-added exercises (all the exercise catalog from the "FitInn" gyms) or a custom exercise
- Add a custom exercise to the exercise catalog (and modify/delete them)
- See a recap for each exercise, of all the exercise executions, as well as a progress chart (line chart)
- Start a gym session (choose from the list of existing ones) and fill out for each exercise in the session today's performance (rep count, weight, execution score, exhaustion score)
- See a recap of any gym session in the past, with a list of all exercise, and their associated weights and reps

## Possible expansions

The App has been created as a solution to a concrete problem. However, to be viable as a standalone product, further features could be added, amongst them:
- Analysis of the user's performance over time, by taking into account the weight evolution, the execution and exhaustion score
- Recommend changes upon the results of the analysis (for instance increase the weight on an exercise, replace an exercise)
- Add a cooperative mode between users, such as a leaderboard (concept known as gamification, people often enjoy competing against each other)
- Add a streak reminder (notification to remind going to the gym)
- Add the ability to share the recap screen of a gym session through social media (WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat...)
- Make gym session plans shareable between users to ease the use of the application together with friends when working out together
